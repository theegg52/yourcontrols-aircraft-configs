# yourcontrols-aircraft-configs

Welcome to my github where I am uploading various profile I have been working on.

All of these are still a work in progress. Please use the issues section to report any issues you encounter.

As i stated above these are all a work in progress. I accept no responsibility if something goes wrong and you are unable to complete your flight.  

Since YourControls 2.7.6 includes a PMDG 737 Profile developed by the team i have removed my profiles from here. Please now use the offical profile included in the latest version of YourControls.

The first profiles available are listed below All of these can be downloaded from the release section.  
JustFlight Bae-146 - Tested with aircraft version 1.0.2  
Duckworks DC3 Mod - Tested with aircraft version 0.3.7  
IniSimulations - A310 Tested with aircraft version 1.1.6  

Other profiles in progress:-     
JustFlight - Hawk  
Redwing - L1049 Super Connie

Please do not message me asking when these will be relased. I work on these in my spare time and these things take time. As soon as they are ready for wider testing they will be uploaded here.
